## Download

See the Custom Converter section in the [WATS Client Installation Guide](https://support.wats.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003392680-WATS-Client-releases) for your version of the WATS Client for how to install a converter.

### Test-sofware configuration

This is an example converter for Stepwize that only supports output in the same format as the example files. Different configurations of the test software will require an accordingly different converter.

### Parameters

This converter uses the following parameters:

| Parameter         | Default value         | Description                                                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| operationTypeCode | 10                    | If log is missing operation code (process code), use this one. |
| operator          | oper			        | If log is missing operator, use this one.			             |
| sequenceVersion   | 1.0.0                 | If log is missing sequence version, use this one.	             |

## Testing

The project uses the [MSTest framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/quick-start-test-driven-development-with-test-explorer) for testing the converter.

It is setup with two tests; one for setting up the API by registering the client to your WATS, and one for running the converter.

The values are hardcoded in the test, so you will need to change the values to reflect your setup.
* In SetupClient, fill in your information in the the call to RegisterClient.
* In ConverterTest, fill in the path to the file you want to test the converter with. There are example files in the Data folder.
* Run SetupClient once, then you can run ConverterTest as many times as you want.

## Troubleshooting

#### Converter failed to start

Symptom:
* Converter did not start after being configured.

Possible cause:
* WATS Client Service does not have folder permission to the input path.
* WATS Client Service was not restarted after configuration.

Possible solution:
* [Give NETWORK SERVICE write permission to the input path folder](https://virinco.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207424113-WATS-Client-Add-write-permission-to-NETWORK-SERVICE-on-file-system-to-allow-converter-access)
* Make a change in a converter configuration and undo the change, click APPLY. When asked to restart the service, click Yes.

#### Converter class drop down list is empty

Symptom:
* The converter class drop down list in the Client configurator is empty after adding a converter DLL.

Possible cause:
* The DLL file is blocked. Windows blocks files that it thinks are untrusted, which stops them from being executed.

Possible solution:
* Open properties on the file and unblock it.
